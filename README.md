# tncode
I believe in Taobao, betta these big sites have seen such a verification code, drag the verification code than the traditional mobile side has a better test to reduce the user's input.  Verification code: third party charges drag code, betta, panda live and many other sites are using this verification code. Or the charges.  I feel very strange, such a large site, actually this function should use a third party, it should be no difficulties to achieve it, so I would like to do with php + js to do the same function, the name is called tncode it, 39 verification code, ha ha!  The main technology to achieve:  1, php cutout  2, js canvas drawing  3, crack interference
